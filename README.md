# GenerationLearning-Python
Machine Learning apliccated show how through generations, it ends up learning by itself. This program is written in python using extra libraries.

//////////////////////////////
IMPORTANT:

OUTDATED:
  This program is outdated, it needs to be translated to python3 (it was written in python 2), 
  most of the problems are basically changing prints, for, etc...
  
LIBRARIES:
  The main file uses a library named "fuzzywuzzy", you may need to install it so I leave you the next code lines (copy and paste them in your terminal), 
  all these instructions work on " Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS ", so keep it in mind.
  
  Install pip3:
      $ pip3 --version                 #Checking you don't have it already
      $ sudo apt update                #Updating the OS
      $ sudo apt install python3-pip   #Installing pip3 for python 3
      
  Install fuzzywuzzy:
      $ pip3 install fuzzywuzzy
      
 Once you have installed all this (pip + library), you still won't be able to run the app since it is outdated, so you can update or wait till I do it.

Update info (Not Important / 29-Sep-2020):
 
This project was made between 2018-2019, by that time my coding skills weren't that got so it lacks pretty much in info on the script and extra info, as I mentioned before, it is outdated, so since now I don't have a lot of time I won't update it, once I got time I will.
Understanding the script shouldn't be that hard since it is a pretty simple program. I will do my best to update this as soon as I'm able.
